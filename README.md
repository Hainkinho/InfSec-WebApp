A small university project to demonstrate brutal information security attacks on an innocent server. Our main focus for this project was to show off one of the biggest web server vulnerabilities - injections as well as broken access control.

## Building

```bash
# Start the server
npm run start

# Start the server and watch for changes
npm run dev
```

### Usefull commands

```bash
# Add default entries

# Delete all entries from the database

```
